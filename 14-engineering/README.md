# Volume 14: Engineering
## The Vestara Engineering Handbook — Standards, Practices, Quality

> **Mission**: Define and enforce engineering standards that ensure every line of code in the Vestara ecosystem is maintainable, testable, secure, and consistent — regardless of which AI agent or human engineer wrote it.

## 🔧 Engineering Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Architecture Before Implementation** | ADR before code for architectural decisions |
| **Documentation Before Coding** | Specs in Blueprint before PR |
| **Strict TypeScript** | `strict: true`, zero `any`, Zod at boundaries |
| **Reusable Modules** | Shared packages in `@vestara/*` |
| **Composition Over Inheritance** | Small, focused, composable units |
| **Tested by Default** | Tests alongside source, real SQLite |
| **Feature-First** | Colocate by domain, not by layer |
| **Backward Compatible** | Additive migrations, API versioning |
| **Security Review Required** | Every PR reviewed for security |
