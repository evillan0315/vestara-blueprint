# VDS Design Philosophy

## Core Tenets

1. **The interface is invisible** — users should feel they are working directly on their problem, not on the UI. Every pixel either serves a purpose or is removed.

2. **Trust through consistency** — a pattern learned in one surface works identically in all others. The same spacing, color meaning, and interaction model applies everywhere.

3. **AI is a participant, not a widget** — AI agents have visual identity, presence, and communication patterns. They are not chat bubbles bolted onto a traditional app.

4. **Accessibility is not a layer** — it is foundational. Color choices, motion, typography, and interaction models are designed for the widest possible audience from the start.

5. **One source of truth** — design tokens are the single point of change. No hardcoded color, spacing, or type value exists outside the token system.

6. **Semantics survive the medium** — graphical and character-cell surfaces
may render differently, but attribution, hierarchy, status, policy, and approval
meaning MUST remain equivalent.

7. **The runtime owns truth** — presentation surfaces express routing intent;
they never invent availability, compatibility, permission, or assignment state.
