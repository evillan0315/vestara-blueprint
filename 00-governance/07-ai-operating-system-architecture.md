## Core Abstraction: Everything is a Runtime

Vestara's defining architectural concept: every active entity is a **Runtime** with a unified lifecycle, health model, permissions, and event emission.

```
Runtime
├── id: string
├── type: RuntimeType     — agent | widget | workflow | session | plugin
│                          | service | model | tool | repository | project
├── owner: string
├── state: RuntimeState   — created | initializing | running | suspended
│                          | degraded | recovering | stopping | destroyed
├── health: HealthStatus
├── permissions: string[]
├── capabilities: string[]
├── metadata: Record<string, unknown>
├── events: EventEmitter
└── metrics: MetricsCollector
```

See ADR-023 for full Runtime Model specification.

## Job Model — Every Operation is a Job

No function call bypasses the Job system. Every action becomes an observable, verifiable, recoverable Job.

```
Job Lifecycle:
Requested → Validated → Authorized → Scheduled
    ↓
Assigned → Running → Verifying → Completed → Archived

Key rule: Verification is a required stage.
A Job cannot reach 'Completed' without passing its VerificationPolicy.
```

See ADR-024 for full Job Model specification.

## Worker Model — Humans, AI, and Systems as Interchangeable Workers

Workers advertise capabilities. The Scheduler matches Jobs to Workers by capability, trust, load, and cost.

```
Worker
├── capabilities: string[]
├── trustScore: 0.0 - 1.0
├── load: 0.0 - 1.0
├── availability: Availability
├── cost: CostProfile
└── latency: LatencyProfile
```

See ADR-025 for full Worker Model specification.

## Intent Model — Goals to Execution Plans

User goals become Intents. The Planner decomposes each Intent into an Execution Plan of ordered Jobs.

```
User: "Add OAuth" → Intent → Planner → Execution Plan → Jobs → Scheduler → Workers
```

See ADR-026 for full Intent Model specification.

## Ownership & Resource Locking

Every resource has exactly one Owner Runtime. Writes go through the owner. Resources support lock states: unlocked, locked, readonly, verifying.

See ADR-027 for full Ownership specification.

## Verification & Trust Engine

The Kernel enforces verification policies on every Job. Workers earn trust scores based on verification outcomes. Low-trust Workers are deprioritized.

See ADR-028 for full Verification & Trust specification.

## Recovery & Failure Budget

Every Worker has an SRE-style failure budget. When exhausted, the Kernel quarantines the Worker and triggers remediation. Long-running Jobs use checkpoints for resumable execution.

See ADR-029 for full Recovery & Failure Budget specification.

## Kernel Architecture

Three-layer architecture: Interface → Core → Runtime. 16-step boot order starting with Configuration and ending with the Interface Layer.

See ADR-030 for full Kernel Architecture specification.

---

## The Fundamental Insight

Traditional operating systems were designed around resources:

- CPU scheduler
- Memory manager
- File system
- Process manager
- Network stack
- Security model

Vestara needs another first-class subsystem: **AI Organization**.

This is not an "AI feature." It is an operating system service — as fundamental as memory management or process scheduling.

---

## Core Architecture: Three-Layer Separation

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    Intelligence Layer                        │

│  Decides WHAT to do                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                            │

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     Governance Layer                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Policy Engine    Authority Manager    Verification Engine  │
│  Audit Engine     Safety Engine        Recovery Manager     │
│                                                             │
│  Decides WHETHER it is allowed                              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                            │
                            ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     Execution Layer                          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Filesystem    Git    Terminal    Docker    Kubernetes      │
│  Database      Cloud    SSH       API      Message Queue    │
│                                                             │
│  Performs the action                                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Why This Separation Matters

The intelligence layer decides *what* to do.
The governance layer decides *whether it is allowed*.
The execution layer performs the action.

This separation means:
- **Models can improve** without weakening safety rules
- **Governance can evolve** without changing intelligence or execution
- **Execution can expand** (new tools, new platforms) without touching governance
- **Safety is consistent** across all agents and all capabilities

## AI Organization: First-Class OS Subsystem

```
AI Organization
├── Agent Registry          — Who exists?
├── Authority Manager       — Who can do what?
├── Task Scheduler          — What happens when?
├── Capability Registry     — What can be done?
├── Trust Engine            — Who is trustworthy?
├── Verification Engine     — Did it work?
├── Repository Guardian     — Is the code safe?
├── Memory System           — What was learned?
├── Audit Log               — What happened?
├── Recovery Manager        — What if it fails?
└── Human Collaboration Layer — When do we ask?
```

### These Are Operating System Services

Traditional OS questions:
> Which process can access this file?
> How much memory does this process need?
> When should this thread be scheduled?

Vestara OS questions:
> Which agent is authorized to modify this repository?
> Which agent can restart this service?
> When should this task be escalated to a human?

These are operating system questions. They deserve operating system solutions.

---

## The Operation Lifecycle

Every action in Vestara follows the same lifecycle:

```
        Operation
            │
            ▼
      Policy Check
            │
            ▼
     Authority Check
            │
            ▼
       Execution
            │
            ▼
      Verification
            │
            ▼
      Audit Record
            │
            ▼
        Learning
```

### Why Every Action Follows This Lifecycle

If every action from the start is represented as an auditable operation, then every future capability — editing code, deploying a service, managing infrastructure, or configuring the OS — naturally follows the same pattern.

This is not bureaucracy. This is consistency.

### Lifecycle Stages

| Stage | Question | Engine |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Operation** | What does the agent want to do? | Task Scheduler |
| **Policy Check** | Is this action allowed by policy? | Policy Engine |
| **Authority Check** | Is this agent authorized? | Authority Manager |
| **Execution** | Perform the action | Execution Layer |
| **Verification** | Did it work correctly? | Verification Engine |
| **Audit Record** | What happened? | Audit Log |
| **Learning** | What should we remember? | Memory System |

---

## The AI Organization Subsystem

### 1. Agent Registry

**Purpose**: Track every agent that exists in the system.

```typescript
interface Agent {
  id: string;                    // Unique identifier
  name: string;                  // Human-readable name
  type: 'implementation' | 'verification' | 'investigation' | 'coordination';
  status: 'active' | 'inactive' | 'suspended';
  capabilities: string[];        // What this agent can do
  trustLevel: number;            // 0.0 to 1.0
  createdAt: string;
  lastActive: string;
}
```

**Operating System Analogy**: Process table. Just as an OS tracks every running process, Vestara tracks every active agent.

### 2. Authority Manager

**Purpose**: Determine what each agent is allowed to do.

```typescript
interface Authority {
  agentId: string;
  resource: string;              // What resource (repository, service, etc.)
  actions: string[];             // What actions are allowed
  conditions: Condition[];       // Under what conditions
  expiresAt?: string;            // When authority expires
}

interface Condition {
  type: 'time' | 'trust' | 'approval' | 'context';
  constraint: string;
}
```

**Operating System Analogy**: File permissions + capabilities. Just as an OS controls which processes can access which files, Vestara controls which agents can modify which resources.

### 3. Task Scheduler

**Purpose**: Determine when tasks should execute.

```typescript
interface Task {
  id: string;
  type: string;
  agentId: string;
  priority: number;
  dependencies: string[];
  status: 'pending' | 'queued' | 'running' | 'completed' | 'failed';
  retryBudget: number;
  checkpoint?: Checkpoint;
}
```

**Operating System Analogy**: CPU scheduler. Just as an OS decides which process gets CPU time, Vestara decides which task gets executed when.

### 4. Capability Registry

**Purpose**: Track what can be done in the system.

```typescript
interface Capability {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  requiredAuthority: string[];
  verificationRequired: boolean;
  safetyLevel: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
}
```

**Operating System Analogy**: System calls. Just as an OS defines what operations are available, Vestara defines what capabilities agents can use.

### 5. Trust Engine

**Purpose**: Calculate trust levels based on history.

```typescript
interface TrustRecord {
  agentId: string;
  taskType: string;
  outcome: 'success' | 'failure';
  severity: number;              // S0-S4
  timestamp: string;
}

interface TrustScore {
  agentId: string;
  score: number;                 // 0.0 to 1.0
  factors: {
    successRate: number;
    verificationCompliance: number;
    safetyCompliance: number;
    recoveryRate: number;
  };
}
```

**Operating System Analogy**: Reputation system. Trust is not binary — it is earned through consistent behavior, just as a process earns resources through efficient use.

### 6. Verification Engine

**Purpose**: Confirm that actions produced expected results.

```typescript
interface Verification {
  taskId: string;
  checks: VerificationCheck[];
  passed: boolean;
  confidence: number;
  evidence: EvidencePackage;
}

interface VerificationCheck {
  name: string;
  command: string;
  expected: string;
  actual: string;
  passed: boolean;
}
```

**Operating System Analogy**: Integrity checks. Just as an OS verifies file system integrity, Vestara verifies that actions produced correct results.

### 7. Repository Guardian

**Purpose**: Protect repository health.

```typescript
interface GuardianConfig {
  protectedBranches: string[];
  requiredChecks: string[];
  maxFileChanges: number;
  requireReview: boolean;
  checkpointBeforeModify: boolean;
}
```

**Operating System Analogy**: File system journaling. Just as an OS protects against file system corruption, Vestara protects against repository corruption.

### 8. Memory System

**Purpose**: Store what was learned from successes and failures.

```typescript
interface Memory {
  id: string;
  type: 'success' | 'failure' | 'pattern' | 'decision';
  task: string;
  strategy: string;
  outcome: string;
  confidence: number;
  timestamp: string;
  tags: string[];
}
```

**Operating System Analogy**: Page cache + swap. Memory stores what has been learned so future operations can benefit from past experience.

### 9. Audit Log

**Purpose**: Record every operation for accountability.

```typescript
interface AuditEntry {
  id: string;
  timestamp: string;
  agentId: string;
  taskId: string;
  operation: string;
  resource: string;
  outcome: 'success' | 'failure';
  severity: string;
  evidence: EvidencePackage;
  decision: string;
}
```

**Operating System Analogy**: System log. Just as an OS logs every system call, Vestara logs every agent operation.

### 10. Recovery Manager

**Purpose**: Restore system state when things go wrong.

```typescript
interface RecoveryPlan {
  taskId: string;
  checkpoints: Checkpoint[];
  rollbackStrategy: 'checkpoint' | 'revert' | 'manual';
  escalationPath: string[];
  maxRecoveryTime: number;
}
```

**Operating System Analogy**: Crash recovery + rollback. Just as an OS can recover from crashes, Vestara can recover from failed operations.

### 11. Human Collaboration Layer

**Purpose**: Determine when to involve humans.

```typescript
interface EscalationRule {
  condition: string;
  action: 'notify' | 'block' | 'require-approval';
  channel: 'slack' | 'email' | 'dashboard';
  timeout: number;
}
```

**Operating System Analogy**: Interrupt handling. Just as an OS handles hardware interrupts, Vestara handles situations that require human attention.

## OS Primitives for AI Governance

Just as a kernel defines process scheduling and memory protection, Vestara defines these as core operating system primitives:

| Primitive | Traditional OS Equivalent | Vestara Implementation |
|-----------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| **Agent Identity** | Process ID | Agent Registry |
| **Agent Authority** | File permissions | Authority Manager |
| **Agent Scheduling** | CPU scheduler | Task Scheduler |
| **Agent Capabilities** | System calls | Capability Registry |
| **Agent Trust** | (no equivalent) | Trust Engine |
| **Agent Verification** | Integrity checks | Verification Engine |
| **Agent Safety** | Memory protection | Safety Controller |
| **Agent Memory** | Page cache | Memory System |
| **Agent Audit** | System log | Audit Log |
| **Agent Recovery** | Crash recovery | Recovery Manager |
| **Human Escalation** | Interrupt handling | Human Collaboration Layer |

---

## Architectural Invariants

These properties must hold at all times:

1. **No agent acts without authority.** Every action requires explicit authorization.
2. **Every action is auditable.** Every operation leaves a trace.
3. **Verification is mandatory.** No task is complete without verification.
4. **Trust is earned.** No agent starts with full authority.
5. **Recovery is possible.** Every action can be rolled back.
6. **Humans can always intervene.** The human collaboration layer is always available.
7. **Governance is separate from intelligence.** Safety rules are not affected by model changes.
8. **The repository is always in a known state.** Checkpoints ensure recoverability.

---

## The Human Engineering Dimension

Software engineering focuses on code.
Human engineering focuses on how people (and agents) cooperate to build systems.

Human engineering includes:
- Authority boundaries
- Responsibility assignment
- Escalation paths
- Trust building
- Accountability chains
- Knowledge sharing
- Decision ownership
- Recovery from mistakes

These principles cannot be bolted on after version 1.0. They are much harder to retrofit than to design from the beginning.

Vestara designs them into the foundation.

*Vestara is not an AI application. Vestara is an AI-native operating system for verified engineering work. The Kernel is not the Dashboard. The Dashboard is a client of the Kernel. AI is not the system — AI is one kind of Worker. The Kernel's responsibility is to ensure that every piece of work is authorized, observable, verifiable, recoverable, and attributable.*
