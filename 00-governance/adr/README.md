# Architecture Knowledge Graph (AKG)

## What This Is

The ADR directory is not a flat document collection. It is a **directed graph** — the Architecture Knowledge Graph — where every node is an ADR and every edge is a typed relationship.

The AKG connects constitutions, architectural decisions, blueprint volumes, runtimes, and organizational roles into a single navigable structure. Both humans and AI agents traverse this graph to answer questions like:

- *What depends on this decision?*
- *Where is this principle applied?*
- *Who must enforce this?*

---

## Node Types

| Node | Source | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Constitution** | `00-governance/` | Product Constitution (Article VIII) |
| **ADR** | `adr/ADR-NNN-*.md` | ADR-100: AI Organization Over AI Assistant |
| **Blueprint** | `XX-volume/YY-file.md` | `23-conversation/04-group-chat.md` |
| **Runtime** | `vestara-ai-core/packages/*` | Verifier Runtime, Conversation Runtime |
| **Role** | Agent definitions | Planner, Engineer, Verifier |

## Edge Types

### `depends_on` — Structural dependency

An ADR may depend on other ADRs. If the target ADR changes, this ADR may need to change.

```
ADR-104 ──depends_on──→ ADR-103
```

Interpretation: *ADR-104 cannot be understood without ADR-103; altering ADR-103 may require updating ADR-104.*

### `referenced_by` — Navigational link

Points to ecosystem artifacts that reference or implement this ADR.

```
ADR-100 ──referenced_by──→ 08-product-constitution (Article VIII)
ADR-100 ──referenced_by──→ 23-conversation/04-group-chat.md
```

Interpretation: *These artifacts are where this ADR's principles appear in practice.*

### `influences` — Organizational ownership

Names the roles (human or agent) that must understand or enforce this ADR.

```
ADR-100 ──influences──→ Planner, Engineer, Reviewer, Verifier, Context
```

Interpretation: *Every agent in the AI organization must understand this ADR.*

## Graph Rules

1. **No cycles.** An ADR must not depend on another ADR that transitively depends on it.
2. **`depends_on` is conservative.** List only direct architectural dependencies. If ADR-B would be incoherent without ADR-A, list the dependency.
3. **`influences` names roles, not individuals.** Use agent role names (Planner, Verifier) or engineering roles (Frontend Engineer), not personal names.
4. **`referenced_by` is maintained.** When a blueprint document or runtime is created that embodies an ADR, add the reference. When one is removed, remove the reference.
5. **ADR frontmatter is a public API.** Agents read these fields programmatically. Do not treat them as prose — every value should be parseable and predictable.
6. **`id` is immutable.** The `id` field (e.g., `adr-100`) never changes, even if the filename or human-readable `adr` label is renamed. All cross-references use `id`, never the filename or `adr` string. This prevents broken links during reorganization.

---

## Future Direction

As the graph grows, the AKG can power:

- **Impact analysis** — *"If ADR-103 changes, what else is affected?"*
- **Agent onboarding** — *"Which ADRs must the Verifier agent understand?"*
- **Architecture Explorer** — Interactive visualization in the workspace UI
- **Consistency verification** — Automated checks that blueprint docs correctly reference the ADRs they implement
- **`vestara blueprint verify`** — Structural integrity checks: all `depends_on` targets exist, no cycles, every `referenced_by` path resolves, no orphaned ADRs, no broken `id` references
- **Architecture Runtime** — A service that indexes the AKG and exposes `findDependencies()`, `findAffectedCapabilities()`, `validateConsistency()` as queryable operations

The AKG is not documentation. It is the **shared architectural memory** that both human and AI participants reason over.
