## 📊 Data Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Local-First** | SQLite on device; cloud is optional replica |
| **Portable** | .vestara folder is self-contained, movable, backup-able |
| **Owned by User** | User controls all data; export anytime |
| **Encrypted at Rest** | LUKS2 + SQLite encryption extension |
| **Versioned** | Migrations are additive and reversible |
| **Searchable** | FTS + vector search on every data type |
| **Minimal** | Store only what's needed; clear retention policies |

| `04-platform` | All platform services consume data |
| `05-ai-core` | Memory and knowledge are data subsystems |
| `08-cloud` | Cloud sync extends data to cloud |
| `11-security` | Encryption, compliance, deletion |
