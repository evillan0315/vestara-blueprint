## 🎨 Workspace Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Keyboard-First** | Every action accessible via command palette |
| **Context-Preserving** | Never lose state — scroll, cursor, selection, memory |
| **Progressive Disclosure** | Simple by default, powerful on demand |
| **Dark-First** | Dark mode default, light mode available |
| **Responsive** | Adapts to any screen size — desktop, tablet, mobile |
| **Offline-Capable** | Full interface works without network |
| **AI-Native** | AI is woven into every panel, not a separate chat |
| **Extensible** | Panels, themes, commands all plugin-defined |

---

## 🔗 Cross-References

| Volume | Relationship |
|--------|--------------|
| `04-platform` | Platform services power workspace modules |
| `05-ai-core` | AI subsystems exposed through workspace UI |
| `22-user-experience` | Design system, animations, accessibility |
| `10-developer-platform` | SDK for extending the workspace |

## Current Architecture (reconciled)

- [engineering-session.md](engineering-session.md) — the engineering session
- [inspector.md](inspector.md) — universal inspector
- [cli-workspace-integration.md](cli-workspace-integration.md) — CLI + UI as shared runtime clients
- [settings-architecture.md](settings-architecture.md) — settings as a runtime control surface
