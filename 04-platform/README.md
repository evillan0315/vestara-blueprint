# Volume 04: Platform Architecture
## The Modular, Reusable, AI-Native Platform Foundation

> **Mission**: Create a modular, reusable, AI-native platform independent of the user interface or operating system. Every Vestara product — Workspace, OS, Cloud, Mobile — is built upon this platform.

## 🏗️ Platform Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Provider-Agnostic** | No single-vendor dependency for any capability |
| **Offline-First** | Full functionality without network connectivity |
| **Privacy-by-Design** | User data ownership, zero default telemetry |
| **Modular & Replaceable** | Every module has a clean interface, swappable implementation |
| **AI-Native** | AI capabilities are first-class platform primitives, not add-ons |
| **Predictable Evolution** | Semantic versioning, additive migrations, deprecation policies |

---

## 🔗 Cross-References

| Volume | Relationship |
|--------|--------------|
| `05-ai-core` | AI capabilities consumed by platform services |
| `06-workspace` | UI that renders platform capabilities |
| `07-operating-system` | OS that hosts the platform |
| `12-data` | Data architecture used by platform modules |
| `14-engineering` | Engineering standards for platform implementation |

---

## Current Architecture (reconciled)

- [engineering-operating-system.md](engineering-operating-system.md) — canonical engineering OS architecture
- [engineering-event-architecture.md](engineering-event-architecture.md) — event store + temporal model
> Earlier service-oriented framing is superseded (see [01-platform-overview.md](01-platform-overview.md)).

**END OF PLATFORM VOLUME OVERVIEW**

*The platform is the foundation. Every product is an expression of platform capabilities.*
